<p><a href="https://ermascustard.com">Erma's Original Frozen Custard</a> is a walk-up frozen custard establishement in SE Michigan. The stores are located in Saint Clair Shores, Shelby Twp. and Warren. 
    The stores use Upserve for POS, DoorDash for online orders and delivery. These systems have been integrated with weather data from Open Weather Map 
    to predict the sales in order to properly staff the stores. Additionally, a reporting pipline has been created which pushes the aforementioned data 
    up to Qlik Cloud using the Qlik DataTransfer tool. The graphic below outlines the piplines.
