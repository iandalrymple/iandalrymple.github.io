<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I have spent the majority of my career in various engineering disciplines in the medical device field. 
    The early years were spent as a manufacturing / process engineer in a high volume production environment. 
    From there I moved to deploying manufacturing lines in support of new product develop. During this time,
    I went back to school and achieved a master's in applied statistics from Penn State University. The statistics 
    training was very useful in support of the process development activities that were required in that role. </p>
