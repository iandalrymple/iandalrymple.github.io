### Summary

<p>
This is the final report for one of the capstone courses in my Applied Statistics 
Masters Program from Penn State University. The intent of the study was to determine if a 
strategy could be developed to fully verify Loctite torque joints using the back-out 
torque. The full report is shown below - grab a coffee and read up. Reach out with 
any questions.
