### Summary

<p>
This is the final report for one of the capstone courses in my Applied Statistics 
Masters Program from Penn State University. The intent of the study was two-fold: 1) characterize 
the back-out torque based on several predictors and 2) determine if a strategy could be developed 
to fully verify Loctite torque joints using the back-out torque. The full report is shown below. 
Grab a coffee, read up and reach out with any questions.
