### Summary
VAERS is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. This is a SELF reporting system for vaccine injury in the USA. The link below contains a portal where zip files can be downloaded of all adverse events recorded since the introduction of the system in 1990. 

[VAERS Data Download](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html)

The files are CSV's and are joined using the code in this project. A few preliminary investigations and graphics are shown but the inten of this project is to serve as a starting place for others that want to perform there own analytics with the joined data. 

Have fun and let me know of any questions as I can be reached via email. Or if you need the full notebook let me know and I can send it along. The repo needs to be cleaned up so I am not prepared to make it public.

### Commentary
This cell takes all the files and concatenates them together based on the key attribute ID. Note multiple entries can exist for the symptoms table for a single AE, hence the outer join. As s todo the data types need to be populated for each of the tables. 

```python
# Locals 
dfVAERSDATA_Initialized     = False
dfVAERSSYMPTOMS_Initialized = False
dfVAERSVAX_Initialized      = False

# @TODO Column datatypes - need to finish  - getting the following warning when reading in files:
# DtypeWarning: Columns (11,13,15,16,27) have mixed types.Specify dtype option on import or set 
# low_memory=False. interactivity=interactivity, compiler=compiler, result=result)

    fullFilename = os.path.join(inputDirectory, filename)

    # Ensure its a file

        # Print the file name to see where it breaks - if needed

# Merge the vax with the symptoms tables have duplicates or can 
# have duplicates hence using full outer join. Merging vax and symptoms first.

```

### Commentary
A bit of pre-processing to clean up the frame and add age buckets.

```python
# Return age bucket for age passed in 
def ageRangeFromAge(inAge):

    # Check ranges 
    if(inAge >= 100):
        return "GTE_100"
    elif(inAge >= 90):
        return "90_99"
    elif(inAge >= 80):
        return "80_89"
    elif(inAge >= 70):
        return "70_79"
    elif(inAge >= 60):
        return "60_69"
    elif(inAge >= 50):
        return "50_59"
    elif(inAge >= 40):
        return "40_49"
    elif(inAge >= 30):
        return "30_39"
    elif(inAge >= 20):
        return "20_29"
    elif(inAge >= 10):
        return "10_19"
    elif(inAge >= 0):
        return "0_9"
    else:
        return "UNKNOWN"

# Fill in the unknowns with negatives for age 
completeDataFrame["AGE_YRS"] = completeDataFrame["AGE_YRS"].fillna(-1)

# Fill in the unknowns with negatives for num days 
completeDataFrame["NUMDAYS"] = completeDataFrame["NUMDAYS"].fillna(completeDataFrame["NUMDAYS"].mode())

# Add a feature for age range 
completeDataFrame["AGE_RANGE"] = completeDataFrame["AGE_YRS"].apply(ageRangeFromAge)

# Make a copy so we can leave the original untouched 
workingVaxFrame = completeDataFrame.copy(deep=True)
```

### Commentary
This cell uses a free socrata API to pull back the cumulative distribution and administered for each vaccine manufacturer for COVID-19 vax only. 

```python
# Taken directly from 
# https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cdc.gov/unsk-b7fc

# Unauthenticated client only works with public data sets. Note 'None'
# in place of application token, and no username or password:
client = Socrata("data.cdc.gov", None)

# First 50000 results, returned as JSON from API / converted to Python list of dictionaries by sodapy.
getResults = client.get("unsk-b7fc", limit=50000)

# Convert to pandas DataFrame
administrationDataFrame = pd.DataFrame.from_records(getResults)

# Convert to date time 
administrationDataFrame["date"] = pd.to_datetime(administrationDataFrame["date"]).dt.date

# Make a copy so we can leave the original untouched 
workingAdministrationDataFrame = administrationDataFrame.copy(deep=True)

# Only return the latest date 
todaysAdministered = workingAdministrationDataFrame[workingAdministrationDataFrame.date == workingAdministrationDataFrame.date.max()]

# Print to file 
administrationDataFrame.to_csv(os.path.join(outputDirectory, "administrationDataFrame.csv"))

# Check data is present 
todaysAdministered.shape

# Example authenticated client (needed for non-public datasets):
# client = Socrata(data.cdc.gov,
#                  MyAppToken,
#                  userame="user@example.com",
#                  password="AFakePassword")

# Alternative method - may be useful later 
# rawResponse = requests.get('https://data.cdc.gov/resource/unsk-b7fc.csv', auth=HTTPBasicAuth(apiKeyId, apiSecretApi))
# stringResponse = StringIO(rawResponse.text)
# vaxAdministeredDataFrame = pd.read_csv(stringResponse, sep =",")
# vaxAdministeredDataFrame.to_csv("vaxAdministeredDataFrame.csv")
```
### Commentary 
Finally we can calculate the total deaths per manufacturer as well as the total deaths as of the date of this post. These stats are for the COVID vax only.

```python
# Get all the values of the type of vaccine to try and find the covid 
covidFrame = workingVaxFrame[workingVaxFrame["VAX_TYPE"] == "COVID19"]

# Get all the deaths per manufacturer
covidDeathsFramePerMfg = (covidFrame[covidFrame["DIED"] == "Y"].drop_duplicates(subset=["VAERS_ID"]))["VAX_MANU"].value_counts().to_frame()

# Convert to a float 
covidDeathsFramePerMfg["VAX_MANU"] = covidDeathsFramePerMfg["VAX_MANU"].astype("float")

# Show the total events 
print("TOTAL DEATHS:", covidDeathsFramePerMfg["VAX_MANU"].sum().astype("int"))

# Show graphs of deaths per million for each mfg 
covidDeathsFramePerMfg["VAX_MANU"].plot(kind = "bar", title = "Total Death Count vs. Manufacturer")
```
