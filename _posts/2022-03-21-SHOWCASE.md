<p>
The <a href="{{"/showcase" | relative_url }}">Showcase</a> link in the header presents a detailed view of the modelling and reporting pipeline 
I have implemented for <a href="https://www.ermascustard.com">Erma's Frozen Custard</a>. The page is still being updated to include more 
source code as made public on GitHub but the pipeline design is well documented..... so check it out.
