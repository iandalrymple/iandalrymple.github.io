<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I have spent the majority of my career in various engineering disciplines in the medical device field. 
    The early years were spent as a manufacturing / process engineer in a high volume production environment. 
    From there I moved to deploying manufacturing lines in support of new product develop. During this time,
    I went back to school and achieved a master's in applied statistics from Penn State University. The statistics 
    training was very useful in support of the process development activities that were required in that role. </p>

<p>In addition to process development the role involved deployment of several SCADA systems (GE iFIX and Ignition).
    While deploying those systems I began to interact with databases and write source code for integrating 
    manufacturing equipment with the SCADA system. While deploying the SCADA systems, I caught the software bug and went back to 
    school again for another bachelor's in computer science from Oregon State. </p>

<p>In 2017, I started a role as an embedded SW engineer working on medical device multi-actor systems. In this role,
    I developed software in C / C++ on STM32 chipsets. I also developed C# testing tools for interacting with the 
    embedded system(s) to perform calibration, read log data and simulate use cases. 
</p>

<p>In 2021, I completed a master's in Data Science from Eastern University. Using my data science skills I have 
    built a reporting pipeline for my business and a machine learning sales prediction pipeline. These projects 
    are elaborated upon within my portfolio.
</p>

<p>I am co-owner of three food service establishments in SE Michigan. All three locations are doing business as 
    Erma's Frozen Custard. The original store has been open since 1942. Check us out at: <a href="https://ermascustard.com"></a>
</p>

<p>On a personal note, I am a Bible  believing Christian with a loving family (1 wife, 1 daughter, 2 dogs and 1 cat).
    We live in SW Michigan. In my spare time, I enjoy researching health and Biblical topics as well as working out.
