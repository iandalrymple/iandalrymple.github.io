<p>I have spent the majority of my career in various engineering disciplines in the medical device field. 
    The early years were spent as a manufacturing process engineer in a high volume product environment. 
    From there I moved to deploying manufacturing lines in support of new product develop. During this time,
    I went back to school and achieved a master's in applied statistics from Penn State University. The statistics 
    training was very useful in support of the process development activities that were required in that role. </p>

<p>In addition to process development this role involved deployment of several SCADA systems (GE iFIX and Ignition).
    While deploying those systems I began to interact with databases and write source code for integrating 
    manufacturing equipment with the SCADA system. During this time I caught the software bug and went back to 
    school again for another bachelor's in computer science from Oregon State. </p>

<p>In 2017, I started a role as an embedded SW engineer working on medical device multi-actor systems. In this role,
    I developed software in C / C++ on STM32 chipsets. I also developed C# testing tools for interacting with the 
    embedded system to perform calibration, read log data and simulate use cases. 
</p>

<p>In 2021, I completed a master's in Data Science from Eastern University. Using my data science skills I have 
    built a reporting pipeline for my business and a machine learning sales prediction pipeline. These projects 
    are elaborated upon within my portfolio.
</p>

<p>On a personal note, I am a Bible  believing Christian with a loving family (1 wife, 1 daughter, 2 dogs and 1 cat).
    We live in SW Michigan. In my spare time, I enjoy researching health and Biblical topics as well as working out.
